- **Ad Slots requested:** This event is fired when an ad has been requested for a particular slot.
- **Ad Slots rendered:** This event is fired when the creative code is injected into a slot and will occur before the creative's resources are fetched, so the creative may not be visible yet.
- **Ad Slots loaded:** This event is fired when the creative's iframe fires its load event. When rendering rich media ads in sync rendering mode, no iframe is used so no SlotOnloadEvent will be fired.
- **Ad Slots viewable:** This event is fired when an impression becomes viewable, according to the [Active View criteria](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/4524488).
- **Ad Slots reloaded:** This event is fired when an already known slots gets destroyed or reloaded.
- **Ad Slots viewability:** This shows the percent of loaded ad slots to viewable ad slots.
